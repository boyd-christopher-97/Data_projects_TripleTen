## Project 1: Golden Age

### Objective
The aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives from IMDb users impacts its ratings. The assumption is that highly-rated shows (we will focus on TV shows, ignoring movies) released during the “Golden Age” of television also have the most votes.

### What Was Done
- Conducted an analysis to identify the "Golden Age" of cinema by examining the correlation between movie ratings and their release years.
- Cleaned the data by handling missing values and transforming categorical data.
- Applied visualization techniques to present the findings, including line plots for average ratings across decades
- Identified key periods with significant trends, and proposed insights into what contributed to the so-called "Golden Age" of cinema.

### Results
The research done confirms that highly-rated shows released during the "Golden Age" of television also have the most votes. While shows with score 4 have more votes than ones with scores 5 and 6, the top three (scores 7-9) have the largest number. The data studied represents around 94% of the original set so that we can be confident in our findings.
