## Project 1: Churn Prediction

### Objective
The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn, helping businesses identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.

### What Was Done
- Developed an XGBoost model for customer churn prediction.
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Achieved an ROC AUC score of 0.9018 on the test set.

### Results
The model successfully identified 90% of high-risk customers, allowing targeted marketing strategies for retention.

## Project 2: Sentiment Analysis

### Objective
To build a sentiment analysis model that classifies IMDb movie reviews as either positive or negative, enhancing the platformâ€™s recommendation system.

### What Was Done
- Used logistic regression with TF-IDF features for classification.
- Preprocessed text data using NLTK and spaCy (tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization).
- Achieved an F1 score of 0.88, surpassing the initial target.

### Results
The model improved the recommendation accuracy by accurately categorizing user reviews.

## Project 3: News Article Classification

### Objective
To classify news articles into predefined topics (science, politics, entertainment, and sports) using a neural network.

### What Was Done
- Built a neural network for topic classification using text preprocessing techniques.
- Used CountVectorizer to transform text data into numerical format.
- Achieved 95% accuracy on the test set with k-fold cross-validation.

### Results
The model accurately classified news articles across various topics, ensuring robust performance.
