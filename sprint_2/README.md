## Project 2: Instacart Insights

### Objective
The mission is to clean up the data and prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers.

### What Was Done
- Preprocess the data by doing the following: verify and fix data types, identify and fill in missing values, identify and remove duplicate values
- Verify that values in the 'order_hour_of_day' and 'order_dow' columns in the orders table are sensible (i.e. 'order_hour_of_day' ranges from 0 to 23 and 'order_dow' ranges from 0 to 6).
- Create a plot that shows how many people place orders for each hour of the day.
- Create a plot that shows what day of the week people shop for groceries.
- Create a plot that shows how long people wait until placing their next order, and comment on the minimum and maximum values.

-Is there a difference in 'order_hour_of_day' distributions on Wednesdays and Saturdays? Plot the histograms for both days on the same plot and describe the differences that you see.
-Plot the distribution for the number of orders that customers place (e.g. how many customers placed only 1 order, how many placed only 2, how many only 3, and so onâ€¦)
-What are the top 20 products that are ordered most frequently (display their id and name)?

### Results
Found how many items people typically buy in one order, the top 20 items that are reordered most frequently, and the top 20 items that people put in their carts first.
